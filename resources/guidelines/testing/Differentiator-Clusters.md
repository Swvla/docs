# Differentiator cluster for Shopware extensions

This section will show you the new differentiator groups which needs to be fulfilled to be to released to the store .

## Cluster variations

* Cluster 1: Your extension offers meaningful use cases that cannot be replicated with other comparable extensions. Additionally, it provides a meaningful integration that is not implemented in the comparison extension.

* Cluster 2: Your extension offers meaningful use cases that cannot be replicated with other comparable extensions. Moreover, it works sensibly with the Shopware standard, instead of using its own technical approaches.

* Cluster 3: Your extension is based on the app system and offers a meaningful integration that is not implemented in the comparison extension.

* Cluster 4: Your extension is based on the app system and offers meaningful use cases that cannot be replicated with other comparable extensions.


## An example of how the clusters are applied

* You build an app: We check your app with other apps from the store to see if we already have similar ones. We use clusters 1 & 2 for this. One of these clusters with the respective conditions must be fulfilled so that it offers added value for Shopware store.

* If no app is found, we compare your app with plugins using clusters 3 & 4. 

* You build a plugin: We check your plugin with other plugins from the store to see if we already have similar ones. We use clusters 1 & 2 for this. 


## Examples of meaningful use of the Shopware standard 

* Uses custom fields instead of own tables. This facilitates data management and querying and avoids inconsistencies or conflicts with the Shopware data model.

* Uses Admin SDK instead of own modules. This allows for seamless integration of the extensions into the Shopware admin interface.

* Offers a headless solution. This enables Shopware to be used as a backend for any frontend applications that can communicate with Shopware via the API.

* Offers a reasonable API connection. This means that the extension uses the Shopware API in a compliant and efficient manner to exchange, update, or manipulate data.

* Precisely adapts to Shopware externally. This means that the extension complements or extends the appearance of the Shopware admin interface without disturbing or altering it, by using the same styles and elements.


## Examples of meaningful use cases that cannot be represented with other extensions

* Offers the possibility to send automatic emails to customers or partners to inform them about important information or offers.

* Offers the possibility to combine the function of the extension with variants.

* Offers the possibility to link the function of your extension with advanced pricing to enable flexible pricing or discounts.

* Offers different configurations for different sales channels.


## Examples of Shopware integrations:

* The extension has meaningfully integrated the Rule Builder into the extension.

* The extension has meaningfully integrated the Dynamic Product Stream into the extension.

* The extension has meaningfully integrated the Shopware webhook integration into the extension.

* The extension has meaningfully integrated the Flow Builder into the extension.
